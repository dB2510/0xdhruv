First we will see what are exactly each of these and then we will see what are the similarities and differences between each of them.
First let&amp;rsquo;s start with normal BLS Signature Aggregation
BLS Signature Aggregation In BLS Signature Aggregation, it aggregates multiple signatures signed using different private keys. Consider signatures as (\(\sigma_0 , \sigma_1 , &amp;hellip; , \sigma_{n-1}\)) over group \(G_2\), with messages (\(m_0, m_1, &amp;hellip; , m_{n-1}\)), then aggregated signature (\(\sigma\)) will be:</description></item></channel></rss>
